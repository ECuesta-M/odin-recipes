        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chile peppers in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.
                </li> 
                <li> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chuck roast and season with salt and pepper. Cook meat until dark brown and crispy on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes.
                </li> 
                <li>While meat cooks, combine softened chile peppers, onion, vinegar, garlic, lime juice, cumin, oregano, agave nectar, and cinnamon in a blender. Process sauce until smooth.
                </li> 
                <li>Transfer browned meat and all juices to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Stir in sauce from the blender. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
                </li> 
                <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
                </li> 
                </ol>
